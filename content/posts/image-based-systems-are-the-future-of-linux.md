### TLDR

I personally believe that image based systems are the future of Linux on desktop, server, and IOT devices. I have been using a custom image of [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg) as my day-to-day desktop image for slightly over a year. My usage of Bazzite has strongly influenced my opinion of what the future could look like.
