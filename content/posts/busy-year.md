### Personal Updates
  
#### Lost Weight

This year, I realized that I am turning 34. In the last 10 years working in IT, I have gained about 50 lbs (up to 205 lbs from 155 lbs). This is not an unusual occurance for tech professionals since we are at a desk all day for upwards of 8 - 10 hours at a time. If you don't budget out time for exercise (and you don't eat the best given you are under stress), the natural reaction is for your body to gain weight. 

This experience has taught me a few harsh lessons.

1. Your clothes don't fit (I went from a size medium shirt to an XL)
2. You don't have the energy you used to
3. You have a hard time keeping up with your kids (or doing your activities
4. The quality of your sleep goes down because you are not eating well
5. You deal with unforseen consequences (such as my legs chafing after a lot of walking)

I had to make a plan to fix this. These consequences feel pretty minor in comparison to other things that could happen to me if I continue down this path. (Heart Attack, Stroke, etc.)

The best advice I ever got was, "You lose weight in the kitchen, you gain health in the gym". It was decided. I started an app called [MacroFactor](https://macrofactorapp.com/) for basic macro calorie tracking and I would try cycling as my form of exercise.

#### The Journey of Cycling

I have always struggled to find a form of exercise that really clicks with me. I have been historically uncoordinated, so I've always found hobbies and things that don't require a lot of physical coordination. It's not that I dislike sports, but growing up I was never interested in the popular team sports.

That is when I got a recommendation from my friend who cycles regularly. He had been trying to get me into it for years, but it never stuck until he told me the benefits of doing it. The best part was it was a low impact exercise and it could be done individually or together with a group.  I was like, "What the heck, what do I have to lose?"
