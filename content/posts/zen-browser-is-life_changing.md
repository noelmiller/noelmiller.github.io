### TLDR
Zen Browser is a browser based on Firefox. It adds the following features:

- Workspaces
  - Container Tabs
- Tabs Sidebar
- Zen Sidebar

It is the browser that I have been using day to day for a month or so now and I am loving it. It has been a game changer for my productivity.

### What is Zen Browser?

[Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) is an open-source browser based on Firefox. It is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is most similar to the [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) and [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) in terms of features and design. The main difference is that Zen Browser is built on Firefox instead of Chromium and that it is open source.
