### TLDR

### What is Zen Browser?

[Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) is an open-source browser based on Firefox. It is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is similar to [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) and [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) in terms of features and design.

The main difference is that Zen Browser is built on Firefox instead of Chromium and that it is open source.

### Tabs Sidebar

The main difference you will see with Zen Browser is the tabs sidebar. This is a feature that I have been missing from Firefox for a long time and I've only been able to somewhat replicate with extensions like [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/). This is the main killer feature for me and might be a turn off for some people. I prefer it this way because I can see all my tabs at a glance and I can easily switch between them. With the inclusion of workspaces, it makes organizing my tabs a breeze.

#### Expand and Collapse the Tabs Sidebar

### Workspaces

Workspaces are a feature that allows you to group tabs together. You can create a new workspace and newly created tabs will be associated with that workspace. You can switch between workspaces to quickly switch between different sets of tabs.

The best way to use workspaces (in my opinion) is to create a workspace for each project or task that you are working on. This way you can keep your tabs organized and not get lost in a sea of tabs. My favorite feature is the ability to isolate tabs using the container tabs feature. You can set a default container tab for each workspace and all new tabs will be opened in that container. This is great for keeping your personal and work tabs separate (or any other projects you may want to keep separate).

#### Create Workspaces

Creating a workspace is easy! Just right-click on the workspace icon in the bottom left corner of the browser and click on the `+` button. Set a name for the workspace and an icon and you are good to go! You can also set a default container tab for the workspace which is recommended!

#### Switch Between Workspaces

You can switch between workspaces by clicking on the workspace icon of the workspace you want to switch to in the bottom left corner of the browser. You can also set a shortcut in the settings menu.
