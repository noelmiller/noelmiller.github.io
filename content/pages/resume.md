### Introduction

I am a self-taught IT Consultant with a strong background in systems and consulting clients. With a decade of professional experience (8 years being in managed services), I have a strong understanding of the IT needs in a wide variety of business sectors. My passion is to automate and simplify IT processes / systems to allow businesses to focus on their business problems and not on technology problems.

I have a wide knowledge base that includes: Servers (Windows and Linux), Networking (Firewalls and Switches), Storage (NAS and SAN), Virtualization (VMware, Hyper-V, Proxmox), Containerization (Docker and Podman), Automation (Ansible), Cloud (Azure and AWS), and DevOps (Ansible, Git, PowerShell, and Bash)

With my varied skill set, I can work with any team in an organization to find ways to achieve desired business outcomes. At the same time, I can assist my team with automating and improving processes that can span across different IT verticals.

I am a strong proponent of continuous learning to keep my skills sharp in an ever-changing industry. I intend to become a Red Hat Certified Architect to further expand my skill set.
