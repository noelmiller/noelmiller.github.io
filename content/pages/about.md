Title: About

### TLDR

Hello, my name is Noel Miller! This is my personal blog where I will be writing about my various projects and other things I am interested in. My primary interests are IT, coding, and music. The topics may expand outside of these areas depending on what I am interested in at any given time.

### What is my day job?

I currently work for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) as a Cleared Maintenance Engineer (CME) Technical Account Manager (TAM). It's a bit of a mouthful, easiest to shorten my title to CME TAM or Senior Consultant. My primary focus in my day job is helping my customer with anything related to Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ansible Automation Platform. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noel-miller-533909113/) for my full resume.

### Professional Interests

#### Information Technology

I have been working in IT for about 9 years now. I have gained most of my experience through working at various Managed Service Providers. I have been a Linux User since 2012 and my favorite distribution is Fedora. Though my preference is Fedora, I have used Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSuse, Arch Linux, Solus, and many other distros as a daily driver.

##### What am I interested in?

- Atomic Linux Distributions
    - [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/)
    - [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/)
    - [Fedora CoreOS](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/)
- Ansible
- Containers
- Openshift (Kubernetes)

#### Programming

I am by no means a professional programmer, but I do have an interest in trying to solve problems by hacking scripts together. The languages I primarily use are Bash and Python. I would like to improve my skills with python since Ansible is programmed using Python. I have written a fair amount of Ansible Playbooks as well to automate all sorts of things.

#### Home Lab

I do have a home lab! It is probably not as fancy as some others have, but it works well enough for my purposes! I will likely do a blog post on this soon about the current state of my home lab. I will likely do an update each year of how it progresses, but no promises!

### Personal Interests

#### Video Games

I have been playing video games since I was a young kid. I primarily play games on PC these days.

##### What am I playing?

- Final Fantasy XIV (Playing through Endwalker currently)
- Final Fantasy XVI
- Deadlock
- Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

##### Favorite Games

- Halo 2
- Super Smash Brothers Melee
- Dark Souls 3
- Elden Ring
- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim

#### Music

I enjoy both playing and listening to metal music. (I enjoy more genres than just metal, but it is my favorite). I still have not released any music as a solo artist, but I am hoping to release some music soon<sup>TM</sup>.
