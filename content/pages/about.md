Title: About

### TLDR

Hello, my name is Noel Miller! This is my personal blog, where I will be writing about my various projects and other things I am interested in. My primary interests are IT, coding, and gaming. The topics may expand outside these areas, depending on what I am interested in at any given time.

### What is my day job?

I currently work for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) as a Cleared Maintenance Engineer (CME) Technical Account Manager (TAM). It's a bit of a mouthful; it's easiest to shorten my title to CME TAM, or Senior Consultant. My primary focus in my day job is helping my customers with anything related to Red Hat Enterprise Linux or the Ansible Automation Platform. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noel-miller-533909113/) for my full resume.

### Professional Interests

#### Information Technology

I have been working in IT for about 10 years now. I have gained most of my experience through working at various Managed Service Providers. Not only that, but I have been a Linux user since 2012, and my favorite distribution is Fedora. Though my preference is Fedora, I have used Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, Arch Linux, Solus, and many other distros as a daily driver.
