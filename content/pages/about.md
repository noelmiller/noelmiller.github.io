Title: About

### TLDR

Hello, my name is Noel Miller! This is my personal blog where I will be writing about my various projects and other things I am interested in. My primary interests are IT, coding, and gaming. The topics may expand outside of these areas depending on what I am interested in at any given time.

### What is my day job?

I currently work for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) as a Cleared Maintenance Engineer (CME) Technical Account Manager (TAM). It's a bit of a mouthful, easiest to shorten my title to CME TAM or Senior Consultant. My primary focus in my day job is helping my customer with anything related to Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ansible Automation Platform. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noel-miller-533909113/) for my full resume.
